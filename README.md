# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Final Course Project 

An R script called run_analysis.R was created to do the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Dependencies

```run_analysis.R``` file will help you to install the dependencies automatically (dependant on ```reshape2``` and ```data.table```)
